PoetryFeeder
============

This application was originally developed for the 2010 International Poetry Festival, held in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, http://www.poetry.nl/

Implementation
==============

The target platform was google appengine, however the code should run on any JVM with the addition of a new persistence implementation suitable to the target platform, e.g. MongoDB, MySQL, etc.
