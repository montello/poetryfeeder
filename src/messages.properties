text.write.main=feed me... <br>Poetryfeeder invites people to add their individual voice, their own tone and rhythm, to a collective flood of words.  <br>Change the order. Renew. Direct, anticipate, initiate or react. The answer will come. Poetryfeeder is always hungry for more... Added words, added value, added movement, added meaning. Until saturation. And beyond.<br>Send your favourite one liners, words or full poems as a <a href="javascript:pop('https://twitter.com/poetryfeeder')">direct message to poetryfeeder</a> via Twitter. Let them run free to mix and mingle with the others.<p>October 30th 2011.<br> The digital poetry experiment has now been closed and archived. Poetry Feeder hosts a collaborative poem consisting of 2300 lines (tweets) of poetry. Would you like to use our collaborative poetry tool as part of your exhibition or event? <a href="mailto:cheryl@hexaplex.nl">Contact us</a>.</p>

text.about.intro=Order and sequence are determining factors when it comes to meaning. The order in which we meet or consume words determines the way in which these are understood, acquire value, and make sense.  
text.about.main=Poetry offers room to play with range and meaning, a free word expedition. By creating a constant dynamic, the physical shift of the words will result in a substantial shift. <br>Poetryfeeder originates from the interplay between language and meaning and pure digital interaction.<br>The roots lie in the mixing of separate spontaneous conceptions, novel ponderings or existing texts. A waxing entity, subject to continuous change, where the value of accidental meaning is concealed.<br>Lines of inquiry:
text.about.1=Order and meaning: moving words results in dynamic value. Develop various ways to move text around and shift words.
text.about.2=Interactive and collective: the possibility to create texts together through dialogue. In an exhibition setting people can create live poetry with poetryfeeder. This offers the dynamics and interaction by using a poem, text, line or just a single word as a starting point and let it grow. During an event this offers the opportunity for poets and audience to interact. Poetryfeeder also offers the possibility of bringing people together in a digital poetry platform for a collective poem that can be viewed and read online.
text.about.3=Happening text: the value of &#147;accidental meaning&#148;. When a random shift in text / words reveals a new meaning, is this just as valid as words that are deliberately put in a specific order? Does conscious order exist, or is a poet in any case (partly) dependent on subconscious order in which the words present themselves? The boundaries of the sublime...
text.about.4=Authorship: &#147;Creation requires a sense of self importance. Or a severe lack thereof. When creation becomes compensation. To legitimise one&#39;s existence.&#148; (Guy Makin). Letting go of supervision / control / claim. What you have added becomes part of a world in itself. After you have contributed you will have to let go. You have no control over what others will add and what that will mean to your words. Are you really willing to share? Will quick minds take hold, or will others beat them to it?
text.about.5=Open and closed: A text is finished. Completed. Re-open / re-use. Poetryfeeder dismantles and dismembers texts and reassembles these: sorted in alphabetical order, chronologically, ad random or by author.
